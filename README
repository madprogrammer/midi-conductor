This program may be used to playback a MIDI file through an external MIDI device
while listening to a human-chosen track played on a MIDI keyboard. The program
will then adjust the tempo of other tracks to match the human playing.

The program may be compiled on a Linux system by running 'make' in the src directory.
The source code of this program is distributed under the BSD license.
